I mostly just followed youtube videos to make the entire webpage work.

I also took most of my inspiration from the artist's official webpage. The webpage was fairly simple so I decided
on making something similar.

For the homepage, I added a picture of the artist in the background with an about section that describes certain achievements that the artist has made as well as some notable songs and collaborations. I used CSS to create the homepage gradient effect.

For the merchendise page, I made containers with interactable scroll buttons. The containers contains the thumbnails of the artist's various merchendise and it's information. If you hover your mouse over the thumbnails, a buy button will pop-up and if you click it, a pop-up prompt will appear asking the user to enter username and password. I'm not really sure what a type of user information is required in order to buy things off the internet so I just used username and password. I used Javascript to make the pop-ups and buttons work in this page.

For the tour page, I made a box that should contain the various tours that the artist have and it's information and a button that takes you to the official website to buy tickets. There is only tour available officialy so I only put one tour in the box.

The videos page contain music videos that the artist has as well as a similar scrollbar from the merchendise page. The videos are not showing properly on the webpage for whatever reason and I can't find anything on the interet to fix it so it just shows a youtube error message. That said, clicking on the video box still takes you to the youtube video in a new tab.

I kept the default font for the entire webpage because I liked how it looked like.
